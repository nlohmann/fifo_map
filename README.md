# `fifo_map` â€“ a FIFO-ordered associative container for C++

## Overview

C++ allows to defined associative containers such as `std::map`. The values are ordered according to their keys and an ordering relation. The `fifo_map` is an associative container which uses **the order in which keys were inserted to the container** as ordering relation.

As it has the same interface than `std::map`, it can be used as drop-in replacement. The code is header-only (see file [src/fifo_map.hpp](https://github.com/nlohmann/fifo_map/blob/master/src/fifo_map.hpp)) and only relies on the STL.

## Complexity

A `fifo_map` object has the space overhead of:
- one `std::unordered_map<Key, std::size_t>` object to store the key order,
- one pointer to this object in the `Compare` object.

Inserting a value (via `operator[]`, `insert`) and removing a value (`erase`) rely on `std::unordered_map::insert` and `std::unordered_map::erase` which have O(1) average complexity and O(n) worst-case complexity. All other methods have the same performance as the equivalent `std::map` options.

## Example

```cpp
#include "src/fifo_map.hpp"

// for convenience
using nlohmann::fifo_map;

int main() {
    // create fifo_map with template arguments
    fifo_map<int, std::string> m;

    // add elements
    m[2] = "two";
    m[3] = "three";
    m[1] = "one";
    
    // output the map; will print
    // 2: two
    // 3: three
    // 1: one
    for (auto x : m) {
        std::cout << x.first << ": " << x.second << "\n";
    }
    
    // delete an element
    m.erase(2);
    
    // re-add element
    m[2] = "zwei";
    
    // output the map; will print
    // 3: three
    // 1: one
    // 2: zwei
    for (auto x : m) {
        std::cout << x.first << ": " << x.second << "\n";
    }
}
```

## Update 
There is another open source code called ordered_map that is being developed and checked.

The code is in the following link:

[ordered_map](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/include/nlohmann/ordered_map.hpp)

For those who would like to contribute to the code, contribute to this open source.

In addition, if there are better things at fifo_map that can be added to ordered_map, please let us know.
